## UI Design
### Font
- I used Google Fonts to explore the various options.
- The project has a main font of Roboto as it is easy to read and modern
- “Sans-Serif” is used as the default backup font in cases where these fonts have difficulty loading.

### Colour Scheme
- The colour scheme is based on creating an environment with energy, excitement and warmth.
- I used Coolors to map out my colour scheme.
- The logo was created with Off-Black and underlined with Orange
- The navbar is created with cream
- The call to action buttons black
- All colours were checked with WebAIM [https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) to check the accessibility of the colours and present a pass

### Icons
I used icons from Font Awesome library. The icons that were used were are all .... themed or used to give meaning to a certain section.

## Wireframes
I have used Balsamic to create low-fidelity wireframes and used Figma to create medium-fidelity wireframes. First I created a basic wireframe for mobile, for tablet and desktop. The website will be easy to navigate by using the navigation bar or by scrolling down the page. I have included a scroll-up button for user convenience.There is a mobile-first focus and therefore I wanted to keep in mind first what will work on mobile.
